> [!CAUTION]
> **PUBLIC SUBMISSIONS ARE CLOSED.** We are not accepting new data submissions and will not pay for recordings. Our backend rejects submissions from users without a pre-established agreement. The setup instructions below are for existing data collection partners only.

> Any public information indicating that we pay for submissions is out of date; if you can, we'd appreciate you letting the source know that the program has ended.

OWL Control is a high-performance Windows app that captures control data from games. These datasets are fundamental to training world models that power sophisticated robots and simulations.

## About

We carefully log keyboard, mouse and gamepad inputs from the active game to a file synced with a mini video of the game. No other windows or control input is recorded. Any other window or input - including any microphone or camera - is not captured.

OWL Control is fully open-source, so anyone can verify its inner workings by reading the code or feeding this page's link to your favorite AI language model. Anyone is allowed to [contribute to the project](./CONTRIBUTING.md)

## System Requirements

- Windows device capable of running games at 60 FPS.
- Keyboard, mouse, trackball, trackpad, Wired/Wireless XBOX or Wired PS5 gamepads. PS4 controllers may be used with DS4Windows.
- A reliable internet connection. Uploading may take a long time.
- Computer games! See the [eligible games list](./GAMES.md).

## Setup

> [!NOTE]
> The following setup steps are only relevant if you have a pre-existing data collection agreement with Overworld. Public submissions are not accepted.

Watch the [Walkthrough Video](https://vimeo.com/1134400699) or follow the steps below:

- [Download OWL Control installer](https://github.com/Overworldai/owl-control/releases/latest).
- Run the installer.
- Launch the app from your desktop or Start menu.
  - Check the bottom right corner of your screen for the turquoise OWL control icon. The app may already be open.
- [Create an account at our website](https://wayfarerlabs.ai/handler/sign-up?after_auth_return_to=%2Fhandler%2Fsign-in). The link is also in the app.
- [Generate an API key](https://wayfarerlabs.ai/dashboard).
- Copy your API key into the app and click `Continue`.
- Review the terms of recording. Only record if you agree with them.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - We don't capture your microphone or anything outside the active game.
> - We screen and filter all the data we receive, and any private information is removed.
> - We will freely release our scrubbed and prefiltered data to the research community under permissive and open-source license.

## Usage

- We accept recordings of [these games](./GAMES.md) in PvE modes only.
- Hit `F5` key to switch recording on and off. Please only trigger this within a game you want to record.
  - A small overlay on a screen corner shows that the app is open and recording.
  - Position, keys, and goose-flavored notifications can be customized.
  - If your game runs slowly while recording, lower settings in `Video Encoder`, or lower the game detail or resolution.
- Recordings will be tracked in the app. Recordings ready to be uploaded are marked in yellow.
- Recordings may be too short or not have enough activity to submit. These recordings are marked with red and tagged invalid.
  - A message why they can't be accepted will appear.
- You can review your recordings by clicking its number. A window will open showing the folder contents.
  - Non-video files in this folder can be opened in Notepad or other text editors.
  - Location of the entire recordings folder can be changed with the `Move` button to the right of `Upload Manager`
- Upload recordings by hitting the `Upload Recordings` button.
  - If your connection is slow, try checking `Optimize for unreliable recordings`.

## Troubleshooting

Software known to interfere with OWL Control:

- MSI Afterburner - Causes problems with recording. Use [Steam Overlay with performance stats](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/3462-CD4C-36BD5767) instead.
- RivaTuner Statistics Server - Often installed with MSI Afterburner. Sometimes causes conflicts.
- Antivirus Software - OWL Control is NOT malware. If you experience problems, you are safe to lower antivirus on OWL Control while problem solving.

If you run into other difficulties, write down what happened and take screenshots using [Windows' snipper tool](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/use-snipping-tool-to-capture-screenshots-00246869-1843-655f-f220-97299b865f6b), then [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/Overworldai/owl-control/issues).

> [!NOTE]
>
> You may get an `.invalid` recording that is marked as Too Long, is longer than 10 minutes, or larger than 150-200MB. If this happens, please [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/Overworldai/owl-control/issues).

## Contributing to AI Research
